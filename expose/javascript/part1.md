## Question 4.
Error occurs. Since the variable `result` declared by `let`, it cannot be accesed by outside of the if scope.
## Question 5.
Error occurs. The variable `result` is declared by `const`, so it cannot be assigned again. But function is trying to reassigning on line #7 which makes #9 to unexecutable.
## Question 6.
Error occurs. Since `const` functions as `let`, the variable `result` cannot be accessed from outside of the `if` scope.
